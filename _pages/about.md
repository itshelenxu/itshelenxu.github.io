I am an assistant professor at Georgia Tech in the [School of Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/). Previously, I was the [Grace Hopper Postdoctoral Fellow](https://cs.lbl.gov/careers/computing-fellowships/hopper-fellowship/) in Computing Sciences at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://cs.lbl.gov/), where I was lucky to be hosted by [Dr. Aydin Buluc](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/). Before that, I graduated with my [Ph.D. in Computer Science](https://credentials.mit.edu/certificate/bce7086eacde5e259b95a31ef69cd6ad) from MIT, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Charles E. Leiserson](https://people.csail.mit.edu/cel/). My thesis was on "[The Locality-First Strategy for Developing Efficient Multicore Algorithms](https://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/143200)."

## Information for prospective students

**I am looking for motivated Ph.D. students starting in Fall 2024! If you are interested in parallel and high-performance computing, there are two paths to working with me:**

- If you are not yet a Ph.D. student at GT, please apply to the [CSE Ph.D. program](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-computational-science-and-engineering) and place my name in the faculty preference list. 
- If you are currently a Ph.D. student at GT, please <a href = "mailto: hjxu@lbl.gov">reach out</a> and include why you are interested in our group, your CV, grad report, a code sample (preferably C/C++), and a writing sample.

## Research interests

- Parallel and high-performance computing
- Cache-friendly algorithms and data structures 
- Software performance engineering
