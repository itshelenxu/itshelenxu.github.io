I am an incoming professor at Georgia Tech in the [School of Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/) starting in January 2024. Previously, I was the [Grace Hopper Postdoctoral Fellow](https://cs.lbl.gov/careers/computing-fellowships/hopper-fellowship/) in Computing Sciences at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://cs.lbl.gov/). Before that, I graduated with my [Ph.D. in Computer Science](https://credentials.mit.edu/certificate/bce7086eacde5e259b95a31ef69cd6ad) from MIT. My thesis was on "[The Locality-First Strategy for Developing Efficient Multicore Algorithms](https://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/143200)."
